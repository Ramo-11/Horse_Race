I felt that the way the blackbelt is functioning is not very clear to the user, so I will explain what it does here.

1- the track is only 6 units, not 15
2- horses still advance based on coin flip
3- the program randomly choose a horse to advance 1 extra step forward
4- the user can guess which horse the program picked
5- if the user guessed it right, it counts towards his "points"
6- if the user guessed it wrong, the horse they picked will go back to the starting point
7- There is a chance a horse can move 2 steps in one round (one from coin flip and one from random "super jump")
8- the user is asked to guess each round.
9- at the end of the program, the user's points are displayed 

For this program, I added more methods in both classes, and it helped me understand how to connect things between objects.

It also allowed me to understand how to pay attention to details (so many errors for small mistakes).
